# What is Blob's Topia ?
Blob's Topia is a game on Ergo blockchain in which you can own blob fighters smart contracts.<br>
Those blob fighters are owning an amount of ERG and can bet an amount for a fight.<br>
Once two blobs wait for the same bet, they can engage a fight.<br>
The winner get all the bets, minus the miner fees and the Blobinator fee.<br>
Both winner and loser get some Oatmeal tokens to be able to feed their blob and Spicy Oatmeal tokens to fight the Blobinator.<br>
By feeding a blob you can increase their Attack or Defense level to make them stronger and increase your winning ratio.<br>
The blobs have also an upgradeable armor and you can choose and upgrade their weapons to make them stronger<br>
The blobinator fee is collected during the fights, 3% of the fight amount.<br>
Once the total blobinator reach 1 ERG, a Blobinator is invocated and the blob can try to bait him with Spicy Oatmeal tokens.<br>
The Blobs have a fixed winning ratio of 1/30 against the Blobinator, the fight cost 2 transaction fees (0.0022 ERG).<br>
